# About Me
- I am strictly on the *Manhaj* of The *Salaf*.
- I avoid speaking before the scholars speak
- **Against Misguidances**:
	- I follow all the 4 Imams, but i do not blindly follow any of them (*Ghair Muqallid*/Non Blind-Follower)
	- I am strictly against *Ikwani*/*Khariji* mentality. Like engaging in:
		- *Takfir* of people 
		- Criticizing the rulers or scholars
- **Scholars**: Some major scholars i take from include:
	- Shaykh Saleh Ibn Fawzan
	- Shaykh Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz
	- Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih Al Uthaymeen
	- Shaykh Nasir Ud Din Al-Albani
	- Shaykh Abdullah Nasir Rehmani
	- Shaykh Wasiullah Abbas
	- And other Salafi & Ahlul Hadith scholars
