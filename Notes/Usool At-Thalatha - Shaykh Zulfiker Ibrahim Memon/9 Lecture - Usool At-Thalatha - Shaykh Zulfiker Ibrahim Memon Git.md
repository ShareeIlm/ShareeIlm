- The People of Knowledge said, Knowledge can be cateogorized into 2 furthur categories:
	1. *Zhair Ul Ilm* (Theoretical Knowledge)
	2. *Batin* (Practical Knowledge)
	3. *Mazhar* (Outer Knowledge)
	4. *Makhbar* (Knowledge related to the reality of the inner soul)
- People of knowledge have said *Zahirul Ilm* (Theoretical knowledge) is that knowledge that can be obtained by learning books, studying issues, penning down principles and benefits
	- This knowledge is received by taking it directly from the people who are qualified (scholars) and by reading books
- When the heart is corrupted, everthing else becomes corrupted
- **Ilm Ul Batin**: that which is established in the heart of the student of the knowledge with:
	- **Clarity** (*At-Tabyan*) 
	- **Certainity** (*Al-Yaqeen*)
	- **Pure clean knowledge**. firm knowledge, based upon the Sunnah, contains knowledge of practical and theoretical issues (*Al-Baseera*) 
	- In addtion it is that which established **Imaan** and **Taqwah** in the heart the student of knowledge (this grants him Furqan, ability to distinguish between *Haqq* and *Batil*, truth and falsehood)

- After *Ilm Ul Batin*, if the the people of misguidance come to him, he will not be deceived by their misguidance 
- *Ilm Ul Batin* can only be perfected with *Zahirul Ilm*. That is, practical knowledge can only be perfected by learning theoretical knowledge. 
- Even John and Chris can memorize *Usool at thalatha* and get full marks in the exam of it. They dont have *Ilm Ul Batin*. As they learned this knowledge to gain some **worldly benefit** and not to benefit their inner self, so as a result, they did not benefit from this knowledge.
	- Knowledge should be sought for the **rectification** and **nurturing** of the **heart**

- *Ilm Ul Batin* is a gift that Allah grants to a person whom he loves. This is due to the fact that they established:
	1. Al-**Khashia**
	2. **Eenaaba**
	3. Establishing what Allah has **commanded** 
	4. Venerating (giving great respect) his legistated **laws** 
	5. Attesting and believing to wanting the **bounties** that he has
	6. Fearing his **anger** and his punishment
	7. Following that which **pleases** him
- If the muslim perfects all of these issues after having knowledge of them, then he becomes from the *Awliya* of Allah 
- *Al-Khashia*: **Fear**, **veneration** and **glorification** of Allah.
	- *Khashia* is based upon **Knowledge**. This is not obtained except by knowledge.
	- The *kuffar* (disbelievers) have no *Khashia*
	- Muslims fear Allah with veneration because they love Allah
- *Eenaba*: is to take away the heart from the darkness of **doubts** (*Zulimastis Shubahat*)
	- We can save ourselves from these doubts also by gaining **Knowledge**.
	- Ibn al-Qayyim said: "*To hasten towards the pleasure of Allah by returning back to him all the time and any action done is done sincerely for him*"
- *At Tahawi Al Hanafi* mentioned in his book *Sharhu Mushkil Athar* (good book for hadith):
	- He says The people of knowledge are of 2 types:
		1. The ulema, *Al Fuqaha*. (the jurist who undrestand the book of Allah, learned the halal and haraam, and learned the sunnah of Nabi (ﷺ) and they have mastered it)
			- The student of knowledge must travel to seek knowledge from them
		2. *Ashab Ul Khashiyti Wal Khushu Ala Istiqama* 
			- (People of fear, veneration and glorification of Allah with humility and firmness)
			- *Khushu*: Humility
			- *Istiqama*: those who accepted the truth and are firmly established on it
	- Those who are from the both types are the best people of knowledge.

- Once Shaykh Zulfiker asked Shaykh Wasiullah Abbas who he thinks is from the *Ashab Ul Khashiyti Wal Khushu Ala Istiqama* (People of fear, veneration and glorification of Allah with humility and firmness)
	- Shaykh Wasiullah Abbas said: if you want to look at a living sahabi during our times then all you had to do was look at Shaykh Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz
	- If you wanted to see somone close to the companion in description and piety then it has to be shaykh Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz

- The Ashab Ul Khashiyti Wal Khushu Ala Istiqama wa Sadaf may not know how to read or write but they are still considered from the people of knowledge. Even if they are not from the ulema/the fuqaha.
- This is because of what their hearts contain of kashiya, eenaba, yaqeen which results them to hold and adhere and follow the guidance and perfect (ehsan) the ibada. This results in them profiting more than the people who have theoretical knowledge and those who know how to read and write.

- Ashab Ul Khashiyti Wal Khushu Ala Istiqama wa Sadaf abandon that which does not concern them and they run to Allah to seek his happiness. When Allah sees them, he grants them understanding and Toufeek of his guidance.
- Theoretical knowledge is not enough to be guided. You need khashiya, khushu and eenaba and allah gives them to whom he wills
- Knowledge should not be restricted to theoretical. It should enable us to rectify ourselves so that we can benefit from this knowledge
- We bring search for companions and people who bring us closer to Allah.
