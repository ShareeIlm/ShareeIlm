>Ibn Majah https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:925 ), Sahih Albani
>- حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو بَكْرِ بْنُ أَبِي شَيْبَةَ، حَدَّثَنَا شَبَابَةُ، حَدَّثَنَا شُعْبَةُ، عَنْ مُوسَى بْنِ أَبِي عَائِشَةَ، عَنْ مَوْلًى، لأُمِّ سَلَمَةَ عَنْ أُمِّ سَلَمَةَ، أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ ـ صلى الله عليه وسلم ـ كَانَ يَقُولُ إِذَا صَلَّى الصُّبْحَ حِينَ يُسَلِّمُ ‏ "‏ **اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ عِلْمًا نَافِعًا، وَرِزْقًا طَيِّبًا، وَعَمَلاً مُتَقَبَّلاً** ‏"‏ ‏.‏
>
>- It was narrated from Umm Salamah that when the Prophet (ﷺ) performed the *Subh* (**morning prayer**), while he said the Salam, he would say: 
>- ‘*Allahumma inni as’aluka ‘ilman nafi’an, wa rizqan tayyiban, wa ‘amalan mutaqabbalan* 
>- (**O Allah, I ask You for beneficial knowledge, goodly provision and acceptable deeds**).’” 
>>Note: To be said after the Fajr Prayer
- Authenticity of this hadith:

	- Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani in nataijul afkaar has verified this narration to be Hasan Hadith|Hasan Li Ghairihi
	- Shaykh Nasir Ud Din Al-Albani has verified this narration to be **sahih**, he also said at-tabrani has narrated this hadith with an authentic sanad

- This hadith is to be said after salah not inside it.
- Nabi (ﷺ) asked Allah this *Dua* during the time after the Fajr prayer.
	- The time directly after Fajr is the most blessed time in the entire day, and in that time, the first thing Nabi (ﷺ) asked is this *Dua*.

>  Al-Jumu'a (62:10)
>- فَإِذَا قُضِيَتِ الصَّلَاةُ فَانْتَشِرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَابْتَغُوا مِنْ فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ
>- Then when the Salat is finished, you may disperse through the land, and seek the Bounty of Allah, and remember Allah often, so you may be successful.
>>Benefit
>>- This shows us the virtue and value of beneficial knowledge as he asked it **first** in the most blessed time of the day
>
>>Does this ayah refer to Jummah or Fajr prayer?
>>- This refers jummah as well as the other prayers according to the ulema
- There are 2 types of knowledge; **beneficial** knowledge and **harmful** knowledge.
- There are 3 types of muslims when it comes to utilizing their 24 hours worth everday:
	1. Those that **seek ilm** the whole day, they are the **best** of people
		- Seeking knowledge is the most important and is the basis of all other things
	2. Those who **work** all day and also do **good deeds** (majority of the people)
		- Knowledge of halal and haram is required before doing a job, so seeking the knowledge of what work is halal and haram preceeds doing the job. This is why Nabi (ﷺ) mention it second in the *Dua*
	3. Those that do **other rightous action**, like fast, sadqah etc
		- You need beneficial knowledge for your deeds to be accepted

- Nabi (ﷺ) mention this *Dua* in order of importance
	- The reason why the *Dua* for **work** preeceded the *Dua* for **actions** is because the time of *Fajr* is when people leave to seek livelyhood
	- This shows the action of making *Dua* when you need it. Like making *Dua* for good health when your sick, similarly here we make *Dua* for good *Rizq* before we leave to find *Rizq*
- It is *Makrooh* to sleep after Fajr
- As we have seen how this *Dua* has the ability to be elaborated this much, we see that Nabi (ﷺ) would say very few words which would speak **volumes** and have **great meaning**. This is proof that his words were **divine revelation** revealed in his heart.

- Knowledge is categorized into 2:
	1. *Al Ilm Ul Nafi'* (Beneficial Knowledge)
	2. *Al-Ilm Ghairu Nafi'* (Harmful Knowledge)
- *Al Ilm Ul Nafi'* (Beneficial Knowledge) has 2 categories:
	1. *Ilm ul Deeni Ul Shar'ee* (Islamic Knowledge)
		- This knowledge is when the slave seeks to comprehend and understand the affairs of the religion, and with this knowledge he adopts the way of guidance in all his affairs and interest (in his life) from beliefs, acts of worship, transactions, ethics and morals etc.
	2. *Ilm Un Duniyaviun* (Wordly Or Secondary Knowledge)
		- This type of knowledge benefits the person in the wordly life
		- Seeking this knowledge is permissible
		- It is included in the textual proofs, that encourage us to do such acts like in the hadith below
		- Sometimes this knowledge becomes Fard Kifaayah, like if the muslim community needs female doctors to help women, then someone has to learn or the whole community may be sinful 
		- This type of knowledge mainly only benefits in the Duniya

>Hisnul Muslim 144 https://sunnah.com/hisn:144 ) 
>- **Qaddarallāhu wa mā shā'a fa 'al.  قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَما شـاءَ فَعَـل**
>- It is the Decree of Allah and He does whatever He wills.
>- Reference: "The strong believer is better and more dear to Allah than the weak believer, and in each of them there is good. Be **vigilant for what is to your benefit** and seek the help of Allah and do not falter. But when you are striken by some setback, do not say: 'If only I had done such and such,' rather say: 'It is the Decree of Allah and He does whatever He wills.' For verily the saying 'if (i.e. if only I had) begins the work of the Devil." Muslim 4/2052.
