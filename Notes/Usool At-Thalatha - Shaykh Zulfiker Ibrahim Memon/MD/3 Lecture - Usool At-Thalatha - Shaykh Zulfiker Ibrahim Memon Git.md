>  Al-Mujaadila (58:11)
>- يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمْ تَفَسَّحُوا فِي الْمَجَالِسِ فَافْسَحُوا يَفْسَحِ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ ۖ وَإِذَا قِيلَ انْشُزُوا فَانْشُزُوا **يَرْفَعِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنْكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ دَرَجَاتٍ** ۚ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ
>- O you who believe! When you are told to make room in the assemblies, make room. Allah will give you room. And when you are told to rise up, rise up. **Allah will elevate those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge**. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.
>
>>Benefit
>>- Elevation is only for those who believe
>>- Those who have knowledge will also be raised in rank
>>- Status of the people will be according to their knowledge

# 10-20

- Belief is based on upon knowledge
- Depending on the knowledge of a person Allah increases their status in this life and/or the next
	- It is not a condition for a person to have knowledge to be known amongst people

>  Faatir (35:28)
>- وَمِنَ النَّاسِ وَالدَّوَابِّ وَالْأَنْعَامِ مُخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَانُهُ كَذَٰلِكَ ۗ **إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى اللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعُلَمَاءُ** ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ غَفُورٌ
>- And of men and AdDawab, and cattle, in like manner of various colours. **Of all of Allah's servants, only the knowledgeable of his might are truly in awe of him**. Verily, Allah is AllMighty, OftForgiving. (Bolded: Innama YakhSHa-lillah min I'badihil-**Ulema**)
>>Benefits:
>>- The word "**Ulema**" has been mentioned in this Ayah explicitly with a definite article. 
>>	- This refers to the knowledge of the 2 revelation: 
>>		1. The speech of Allah
>>		2. The Sunnah of Nabi (ﷺ)
>>- Those who truely **fear** (Khashiya) Allah are those that have knowledge
>>- **Knowledge** is **propotional** to **fear** of Allah
>>	- more knowledge = more fear
>>	- less knowledge = less fear
>>- The more you **fear** Allah the **close** you get to him. And this is only possible if you have knowledge
>>	- hence, more knowledge = more close to Allah

- Those who fear Allah are always conscious of Allah's Commands and Prohibitions
- This Ayah refutes those who belittle the scholars
- Hence, all slaves of Allah fear Allah, and the most of those who fear Allah are the scholars, and the scholars fear Allah most due to their knowledge
- A person who has knowledge will react differently in the face of knowledge than the one who does not have knowledge

>  Taa-Haa (20:114)
>- فَتَعَالَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ ۗ وَلَا تَعْجَلْ بِالْقُرْآنِ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يُقْضَىٰ إِلَيْكَ وَحْيُهُ ۖ **وَقُلْ رَبِّ زِدْنِي عِلْمًا**
>- Then High above all be Allah, the True King. And be not in haste with the Quran before its revelation is completed to you, and say:"**My Rabb! Increase me in knowledge.**"
>>Benefit
>>- There is nothing that is asked in excessiveness in the Quran **except in Knowledge**
>>- The only thing Nabi (ﷺ) was asked by Allah was make dua for increase in knowledge
>>- One thing Allah has permitted us to ask for without any restrictions is knowledge
>>- Shaykh: let the most of your lips (for dua) be for *rabbi zindi ilma*
>>- this is the first dua Allah asked Nabi (ﷺ) to make

# 20-30

- There is a dua for drinking milk, Allahuma bariklana fihi wa zindna minhu
- The reason why this dua is mentioned with increase is because:
	- **Milk is interpreted as knowledge is Islam**
- If you see milk in your dream, then that milk means knowledge 
- When Nabi (ﷺ) saw a dream where milk was dropped from his fingers and Umar RA was drinking from it
	- Prophet of Allah Muhammad (ﷺ) interpreted Milk as knowledge
	- So if someone, drinks milk, is around milk or is holding milk etc... In their dream, then that may be a glad tiding for that person that Allah will bless them with beneficial knowledge (knowledge of divine revelation)
- You should beg the most for knowledge so you should ask Allah remembering that Allah's treasures have no limits and that he may grant it to you if you as him sincerely
- Allah command Nabi (ﷺ) to ask for abundance in knowledge

>  Az-Zumar (39:9)
>- أَمَّنْ هُوَ قَانِتٌ آنَاءَ اللَّيْلِ سَاجِدًا وَقَائِمًا يَحْذَرُ الْآخِرَةَ وَيَرْجُو رَحْمَةَ رَبِّهِ ۗ قُلْ **هَلْ يَسْتَوِي الَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُونَ وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ** ۗ إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ
>- Is one who is obedient to Allah, prostrating himself or standing during the hours of the night, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the Mercy of his Lord? Say:"**Are those who know equal to those who know not**?" It is only men of understanding who will remember.
>>Benefit
>>- the ignorant ones raises the ignorant one
>>- Allah raises the truly knowledgeable ones
- From the signs of the day of judgement is that the ignorant ones will be promoting the ignorant ones. 
	- And this is happening in our time

>  Aal-i-Imraan (3:18)
>- شَهِدَ اللَّهُ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ **وَأُولُو الْعِلْمِ** قَائِمًا بِالْقِسْطِ ۚ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ
>- Allah bears witness that La ilaha illa Huwa, and the angels, **and those having knowledge**; maintaining His creation in Justice. La ilah illa Huwa, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
>>Benefit
>>- Allah, the one who is the greatest, testifies that there is no one worthy of worshipping in truth except Allah
>>	- Allah himself testifies to his tawhid, 
>>- Allah also includes the testimony of 2 different groups, 
>>	1. The angels 
>>	2. The People of knowledge
>>- The angels because they have knowledge and the humans and jinn whom have been granted knowledge, hence Allah has honored them by the way of mentioning their testimony in conjunction to his testimony
>>- Since they testimony here is for the oneness of Allah, the first and the most noble type of knowledge you need to seek is the knowledge of Tawhid, the knowledge of Allah (ILM UT Tawheed)


>Muslim 1037b https://sunnah.com/muslim:1037b 
>- Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: 
>	- "**If Allah wants to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the religion**. ..." 
>>
>>- this is called as *Tafakkuk*
>>- here, *Tafakkuk* is restricted to to divine knowledge only
>>- True knowledge and correct understanding **can only be granted by Allah**.

- There are 3 types of people when it comes to seeking knowledge:
	1. They seek knowledge and are granted beneficial knowledge, which is the correct understanding
	2. They seek knowledge and are not granted the correct understanding
	3. They seek knowledge but are misguided and with this misguidance, misguide others.
- So abundance in knowledge does not mean you will always have the correct understanding of the religion
	- For this reason you may see a person who knows all the hadiths of Nabi (ﷺ) but he will never act upon any of those hadiths as he was not granted the true understanding of the knowledge
		- Because if he had been granted the true understanding of that knowledge then the fruits of that correct understanding would result him in acting upon that knowledge
- the correct understanding of the deen of it is only reserved and granted to the people of truth (i.e. those who are following the way of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ)
- Abdullah Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) once slept at the house of Nabi (ﷺ). Once when Nabi (ﷺ) got up for the night prayer, Abdullah Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) readied the vessel for wudu for Nabi (ﷺ) in advance, upon hearing about this action, Nabi (ﷺ) made dua of Ibn Abbas saying "**O Allah grant him the correct understanding of the religion and teach him at-taweel** (tafsir of the Quran)"
	- The first part of this dua can be found in the Sahih ("O Allah grant him the correct understanding of the religion")
	- Hence, true beneficial knowledge is only gained by correct understanding 

# 50-60
---
- Every deviant group in Islam present evidences but they do not have the correct understanding of that evidence
- Correct understanding of the religion is obtained by seeing how the Sahaba understood it. But why the Sahaba? Because:
	1. They were the **best** of all the people after the prophets
	2. They **learned** the religion sitting at the feet of Nabi (ﷺ)
	3. They were the most **knowledgeable** when it came to the affairs of the Nabi (ﷺ)
- We all love the Sahabas, first Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (RA), then Umar Al-Khattab (RA), then Uthman Bin Affan (RA), then Ali (RA), then all the companions



>Timridhi 2646 https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2646 )
>- Narrated Abu Hurairah: that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 
>	- "**Whoever takes a path upon which to obtain knowledge, Allah makes the path to Paradise easy for him**."


# 60-70

>Hadith; Riyad As Saliheen (Bukhari & Muslim) 1378
>- Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, 
>	- "The **guidance and knowledge** with which Allah has sent me are like abundant rain which fell on a land. 
>		- A fertile part of it **absorbed the water** and brought forth profuse herbage and pasture; and solid ground patches which **retained the water** by which Allah has benefited people, who drank from it, irrigated their crops and sowed their seeds; 
>		- and another sandy plane which could **neither retain the water nor produce herbage**. 
>	- Such is the similitude of **the person who becomes well-versed in the religion of Allah and receives benefit from the Message entrusted to me by Allah, so he himself has learned and taught it to others**; 
>	- such is also the similitude of **the person who has stubbornly and ignorantly rejected Allah's Guidance with which I have been sent**."

- Sufyan at Thawri said: i do not know of any action in the religion which is better than seeking and preserving knowledge for the person is the one who for who Allah SWT intended good for
- One of the students of Imam Shafi'ee said he heard Imam Shafi'ee say: 
	- That there is nothing greater and superior and better after fulfilling the obligatory obligations except that you seek knowledge is the best action after your obligatory acts
	- Someone asked him: not even *Jihad* in the way of Allah?
	- He replied: Even jihad is secondary when it comes to seeking knowledge
		- (Why?: Because if a person does not know the *Fiqh* of *jihad*, how will he do *jihad* in the way of Allah)

> Story of Imam Malik and a student of knowledge
>- A young student whose name is Yahya came to imam Malik from AL-Andalus all the way to madina, (sidenote: he was one of the last students to hear the muwatta from Malik)
>- When Yahya sat down during the lecture of Malik, malik asked his name to which he replied by his name
>- Imam Malik said: "O Yahya, for Allahs sake, upon you is to become a serious student of knowledge"
>- And when Yahya died, Imam Malik said, i have not seen such a Janazah in my entire life 
>- I saw on the day of his Janaza all the great scholars crowding around his shrouded body and were fighting to bury him
>	- When the Ameer saw this, and asked why all the scholar were around this young man, the mayor of madina said "nobody lead his janaza, postpone his janzah"
>	- Then the mayor said, amongst you scholars only those who loved the man the most come forward, so rabea came forward
>	- So the great scholar started to bury the man

>Another story of Imam Malik & Yahya 
>- Once an elephant went loose in Madina 
>- All the students of knowledge went out to see this elephant except Yahya
>- So Imam Malik asked Yahya, why don't you go and see the elephant
>- Yahya smiled and replied, I came here to seek knowledge, not to see elephants
>- Upon hearing this, Imam Malik smiled, and he knew he was a smart one
>	- then yahya became the closest to malik, and he is one of the last ones to narrate the muwatta of Malik.

- Look at how Allah elevates the ranks of students of knowledge who were now known amongst the people. Great scholars had come to his funeral.
- There is nothing greater on this earth than knowledge.

- There is no such thing as failing when gaining knowledge
	- You do not just give up and stop gaining knowledge
- The best way to learn arabic is to read alot of the Quran and the hadith of Nabi (ﷺ)
