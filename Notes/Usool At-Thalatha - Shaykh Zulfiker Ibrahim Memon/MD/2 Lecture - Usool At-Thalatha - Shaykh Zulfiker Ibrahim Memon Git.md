## Topic: **10 Key Point To The Virtues Of Seeking Knowledge**
## **Point 1: Knowledge Is The Key To Guidance**
- With knowledge, a person knows what pleases and displeases Allah

 >  Taa-Haa (20:123) First point proof
>- قَالَ اهْبِطَا مِنْهَا جَمِيعًا ۖ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ ۖ **فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ مِنِّي هُدًى فَمَنِ اتَّبَعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا يَضِلُّ وَلَا يَشْقَىٰ**
> - Said:"Get you down, both of you, together, some of you are an enemy to some others. Then if there comes to you guidance from Me, then **whoever follows My Guidance shall neither go astray, nor fall into distress and misery**.

## **Point 2: Knowledge Is The Foundation Of Every Single Act Of Worship**
- You cannot worship Allah on **ignorance**
- Worship is not accepted unless it is with **sincerity** to Allah and it follows the **guidelines** Allah set

>  Al-Kahf (18:110) Second point proof
>- قُلْ إِنَّمَا أَنَا بَشَرٌ مِثْلُكُمْ يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ أَنَّمَا إِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ فَمَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ **عَمَلًا صَالِحًا** وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا
>- Say:"I am only a man like you. It has been inspired to me that your Ilah is One Ilah. So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Rabb, let him **work righteousness** and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Rabb."
- Here Allah says "*A'mala Saliha*" and not "*A'mala*" hence **actions must be righteous** (Saliha), in accordance to the **divine revelations**. The actions should not be something that comes from ones **intellect without divine revelation** as these actions are **not Righteous** (Saliha)
- Based on point 2, the scholars have said that the **blind follower does not worship Allah as he has no knowledge**

## **Point 3: Knowledge Teaches The Slave What Protects Him From The Plots Of The Shaytaan**
- If you do not have knowledge, you are an easy target for Shaytaan to whisper and confuse you and misguide you
- Knowledge will teach you how to retaliate against your enemies
- It also teaches a person how to **protect himself in times of fitnah, trails and tribulations**
- So you should hold firmly to what Allah has revealed and this can only be done with knowledge
- Hence, **knowledge protects and drives away from harm**

## **Point 4: Allah Loves Knowledge And Loves The Scholars**
- Allah has **praised** and **venerated** the **scholars**
- Allah **loves** that his **slaves seek knowledge**
- That is why we see that the greater the knowledge of scholars, the closer they are to Allah and the more they love Allah
- You **need knowledge to love Allah**, and **for Allah to love you necessitates that you seek knowledge**
- There is nothing mentioned in the **Quran** with such a **high status** greater than **the act of seeking knowledge and knowing Allah**
 
## **Point 5: By Seeking Knowledge, The Slave Obtains Knowledge Of His Creator**
- Knowledge is of different types, the knowledge which has the **most reward** is **knowledge of Allah**, that is, **Ilm Ut Tawheed**
	- So the slave learns about 99 Names of Allah|Asma Ul Husna (dominion, might, etc) and Allah's attributes (hands, face etc...)
- We need to know the **names** and **attributes** of Allah so that we can **recognize our God** and worship him alone
- The first type of knowledge you should seek is the **knowledge about Allah**
- Believing in the **perfect attributes** of Allah has an **positive impact** on the life of a believer. 
	- When the slave is in **need**, he will know that Allah is the one who **gives**
	- When the slave **sins**, he will know that Allah is the most **merciful**
- Attributes of the creation are **imperfect**, the attributes of Allah are **perfect**
- All of these benefits **cannot be achieved without knowledge**
 
>  Ash-Shura (42:11)
>- فَاطِرُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ جَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِنْ أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَاجًا وَمِنَ الْأَنْعَامِ أَزْوَاجًا ۖ يَذْرَؤُكُمْ فِيهِ ۚ **لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ** ۖ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ
>- The Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you mates from yourselves, and for the cattle mates. By this means He creates you. **There is nothing like unto Him**, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.

## **Point 6: With Knowledge, True Respect And Honor Is Obtained, In This World And The Hereafter**
- Proper Knowledge of the deen raises the status and the rank of a person 
- This respect and honor will not only be limited to this life, but it will extend to the hereafter
 
>  Al-Mujaadila (58:11)
>- يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمْ تَفَسَّحُوا فِي الْمَجَالِسِ فَافْسَحُوا يَفْسَحِ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ ۖ وَإِذَا قِيلَ انْشُزُوا فَانْشُزُوا **يَرْفَعِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنْكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ دَرَجَاتٍ ۚ** وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ
>- O you who believe! When you are told to make room in the assemblies, make room. Allah will give you room. And when you are told to rise up, rise up. **Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge**. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.

## **Point 7: Knowledge Leads You To Good Manners**
- Only when you **have knowledge**, you **achieve good manners**
- **True knowledge** cannot be **without good manners**
- Knowledge **necessitates** good manners
- With this **knowledge**, he can also **detect bad manners**
- Good manners **precede** seeking knowledge
- Islam teaches us a way of good conduct that is **free of offending others**

## **Point 8: Knowledge Enable One To Do Good Actions (Like Charity, Prayer Etc.)**
 
>Hadith, Sahih Muslim 2674
>- Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:
>- He who called (people) to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">righteousness</mark>, 
>	- there would be reward (assured) for him **like the rewards of those who adhered to it, without their rewards being diminished** in any respect. 
>- And he who called (people) to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">error</mark>, 
>	- he shall have to carry (the burden) of its sin, **like those who committed it, without their sins being diminished** in any respect
 
>Hadith, Sahih Muslim 2674
> - It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah said:
> - "When a man dies all his good deeds come to an end except three: 
> 	1. Ongoing **charity** (Sadaqah Jariyah), 
> 	2. Beneficial **knowledge** and 
> 	3. A righteous **son** who prays for him
>>Benefits
>>- Out of all of these:
>>	- A son can die
>>	- Ongoing charity can end
>>- But knowledge is the one that is **guaranteed to be continuous** without any interruption, 
>>	- So if you seek knowledge, obtain knowledge, and teach knowledge, **your investment is guaranteed and never cut off until the day of judgement**

## **Point 9: True Knowledge Is A Shield To Protect Oneself**
- **True knowledge** helps you **differentiate** between **a chameleon, a celebrity, a scholar and a storyteller**.
- Knowledge can only be learned from those who are **qualified**, those who are **endorsed** by the scholars and those who **inherit** knowledge from the **Isnad** (The chain of transmission from Nabi (ﷺ))
## **Point 10: Allah Prefers And Gives A High Status To One Who Has Knowledge**
- Allah taught Adam AS the **names of everything**, and due to this **knowledge** of his, Allah commanded the angels to **prostrate** to Adam AS
- When the dog has been mentioned in the Quran, the dog who has the **knowledge** of hunting (hunting dog) was **given preference over the dog that does not have knowledge**

# Conclusion
- From this we can conclude, **seeking, obtaining and teaching knowledge** is the **best profession**. 
- **Talib Ul Ilm** (Student Of Knowledge) is the **best** and **the most rewarding profession** in **this life** and the **next**.
