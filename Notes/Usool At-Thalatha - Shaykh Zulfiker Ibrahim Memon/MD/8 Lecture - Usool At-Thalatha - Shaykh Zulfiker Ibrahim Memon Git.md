- There was an Imam of the Arabic Language; *Abd Al Abbas Ahmed Ibn Yahya As Shaybani* (Popularly known as Tha'lab) [born after 200 - Died 291H]
	- He was a Thiqqat and and imam when it came to the Arabic language
	- He had a student called Al Imam Abu Bakr Ibn Muja who was born in 245 and died in 325 H.
	- Al Imam said, i was with my teacher and my teacher said to me "*O Abu Bakr, the people of the Quran, studied the Quran and they were successful. The people of the Fiqh, studied the Fiqh and they were successful. The people of the Hadith, studied the hadith and Allah granted them success. But me, i studied with Zaidan Amr*"
		- *Zaidan Amr* is used when you teach the Arabic language
			- Whether it is *Zaidan*, *Zaidun* or *Zaidin*
- Abu Bakr said, i left my shaykh and went home. And in that night i saw Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) in my dream and he said to be "*I give my salam to ibn abbas, that indeed you are a person of knowledge which is Mustatil*" 
	- Mustatil is that type of knowledge which spread over the muslim world and by which all people benefit from 
- Now we find in 1442H, the ulema of our day still benefit from Tha'lab in the Arabic knowledge and consider him to be a great Imam and authority. When it comes to dispute, his ruling is presented forward. They use his explanation to understand *Tafsir Al Hadith* and strange words which are not known.

- Study every single subject from *Ilm Ul Muqasit* along with some *Ilm Ul Ala* which will help you master *Ilm Ul Muqasit*
- Do not deeply engross yourself in studying Uloom Ul A'la|Ilm Ul A'la because that may deprive a student of knowledge of reaching his goal which is to master Uloom Ul Muqasit|Ilm Ul Muqasit.

	- So Uloom Ul A'la|Ilm Ul A'la became Uloom Ul Muqasit|Ilm Ul Muqasit for him (the *tool* to achieve the *goal* became the *goal* instead)
- Some slaves of Allah do alot of Nafil|Nawafil but they fall short in the Obligatory acts (Fardh|Fard)
	- This causes them to be deprived of the *Barkah* of time and action
- *Mutabarijat*, those women who free mix with men
