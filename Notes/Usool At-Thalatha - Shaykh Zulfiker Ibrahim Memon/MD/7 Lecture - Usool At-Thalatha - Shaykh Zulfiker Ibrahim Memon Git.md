- **Al Uloom as shari'a**, means the sharii types of knowledge.
- *Al Ilm Ul Sharii* is having knowledge with regards to the deen of Allah.
- *Al Uloom As Sharia* has 3 types as said in Ibn Al Qayyim's *Qasida Noniya*.
- Beneficial *Shar'ee* knowledge is divided into 3 categories 
	1. **Ilm ul Aqeedah**
		- Knowledge of the Creed 
		- It is Theoretical (*Ilmiya*)
		- The basis of obtaining this type of knowledge is knowing the *99 Names of Allah|Asma wa Siffat* of Allah and everything a person needs to believe when it comes to the different aspects of *imaan.*
		- Usool At-Thalatha comes under this category.
	2. **Maarifatul Amr Wal Nhi'**
		- Knowledge of the *Halal* And *Haraam*
		- It is Practical (*Amaliya*)
		- Knowledge of what Allah has commanded and what he has prohibited
		- AKA, *Fiqh* of *Halal* and *Haraam*.
	3. **Ilm Ul Jazah** (Knowledge of Reward [for a servants actions])
		- This reward is with *Adl* and *Ahsan* (Justice and Goodness).
		- It includes worldly reward as well as non-worldly reward.
		- It also includes the recompense for committing sins.

- The early deviations was in the *Asma Wa Siffat* of Allah.
	- So the early books of *Tawhid* like Imam Bukhari's *Kitaab At Tawheed* was based on the *Tawheed* of *Asma Wa Siffat* of Allah.
- (some content shifted to 0-10)
- When Shaykh-Ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah talked about the subject of the Quran, he made a statement that the Quran, from the beginning till the end, is about Tawheed and that the conclusion of the Quran can be found in 001 Surah Al-Fatiha.
	- He said the *Mauzu* (subject) of the Quran is divided into 3 parts:
		1. 1/3 about the *Tawheed*
		2. 1/3 about the *Halal* And *Haraam*
		3. 1/3 about the Stories and *Jazah* (Reward)
	- Hence, by this ordering, *Ilm Ul Aqeedah* takes preference before the rest

- On the 3 parts of the Quran:
	1. First is **Theoretical**
	2. Second is **Practical**
	3. Third is **Reward** for believing **Theoretically** and **Practically**
- Theoretical knowledge (*Ilmiya*) precedes Practical knowledge (*Amaliya*).
- Iman always precedes actions in the Quran; "*il-al-lazina Amanu wa Amil-us-Salihat*"  (Except those who believe and do righteous deeds)
	- You will never find actions preceding Iman in the Quran
- This refutes those who say "*Imaan has no role in Actions*"
- *Imaan* is *Ilm Ul Aqeedah* in this context

- Main purpose of *Ilm Ul Shar'ee*
- The people of knowledge say, the path a student of knowledge takes is categorized into 2:
	1. **Uloom Ul Muqasit**
		- Those type of knowledge which are connected to aqeedah, actions, obedience, contemplation and taking heed
		- Eg: *Ilm Ul Aqeedah, Fiqh, Tafsir, Fawaid, Seerah, Adab As Shar'ee, Harith, Sulook, Jazah*, etc...
	2. **Uloom Ul A'la**
		- Those types of subjects which help you to study and master *Uloom Ul Muqasit*
		- Eg: *Uloom Al lughviy* (Different sciences pertaining to the **Arabic** language), *Ilm Ul Usool Al Fiqh, Usool At Tafsir, Usool Al Hadith* 
		- These are tools to help you understand *Uloom Ul Muqasit*

- Example: Learning Arabic (*Uloom Ul A'la*) to understand the Quran (*Uloom Ul Muqasit*)
- *Ilm Ul Nasik Wal Mansook* (Knowledge of abrogation) is *Uloom Ul A'la* for understanding Halal and Haraam in the Quran to know which ruling has been abrogated

# 50-60

- *Ilm Ul Aqeedah* and *Tawheed* must be learned first by a muslim
- The student of knowledge should start with *Uloom Ul Muqasit* BUT he starts with the **abriged (summarised) books** until he is able to understand the issues under discussion at a good level.
- Books that are not summarised and are the full version are the *Mutawarat*
- Books that are summarised/abriged are the *Muktasarat*
- Full Version: *Mutawarat*
- Summarised Version: *Muktasarat*
- Example, A beginner should start with the summarised version of Sahih Al Bukhari which is a single volume (*Mukstasarat*) instead of the 9 volumes full book (*Mutawarat*)

- *Al Usool At Thalatha* is a different book from *Thalathat Ul Usool*
- *Al Usool At Thalatha* is a from the *Muktasarat*
- Benefits of reading the *Muktasarat*:
	- The main points are summarised for you
	- The wording is easy to understand
